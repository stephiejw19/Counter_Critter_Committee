  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why are invasive species a problem?",
      "answer": "Invasive species harm native ecosystems by outcompeting native species, disrupting food chains, spreading diseases, and causing economic damage to agriculture and infrastructure. They often lack natural predators in their new environment, allowing populations to explode."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I kill spotted lanternflies if I see them?",
      "answer": "Yes. If you see a spotted lanternfly, you should kill it. Stomp adults and nymphs, and scrape egg masses into a bag with alcohol or hand sanitizer. Then report your sighting to your state agriculture department."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get in trouble for killing spotted lanternflies?",
      "answer": "No. In affected states, residents are actually encouraged to kill spotted lanternflies on sight. There are no protections for this invasive pest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are deer really invasive?",
      "answer": "White-tailed deer are native to North America, but overabundant populations can cause invasive-like problems in many areas. Without natural predators and with abundant food sources, their populations have grown far beyond historical levels, causing significant ecological and economic damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most important thing I can do about invasive species?",
      "answer": "Learn to identify invasive species in your area, report sightings early, and help prevent spread by not moving firewood, cleaning equipment, and checking vehicles for egg masses or hitchhiking pests before traveling."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is spotted lanternfly season?",
      "answer": "Spotted lanternflies are visible from spring through late fall. Eggs hatch April-July, nymphs develop May-July, and adults are present July-December. Egg masses can be found and destroyed throughout winter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will spotted lanternflies harm humans or pets?",
      "answer": "No. Spotted lanternflies do not bite, sting, or harm humans or pets. They are primarily a threat to plants and agriculture."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I remove Tree of Heaven?",
      "answer": "Tree of Heaven is the preferred host for spotted lanternflies. Removal requires cutting and treating stumps with herbicide, as they resprout vigorously. Some areas recommend leaving a few trees as 'trap trees' treated with insecticide. Check local guidance before removal."
